# The problem: Plastic waste

.pull-left[ 
- US recycled less than 9% of its plastic waste.
- EU, recycled about 30%. However, this number is what is collected, not from what is in circulation*. 
- China’s ban on plastic trash
- Plastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050
- Economics of plastic recycling historically have been challenging
- Little financial incentive to encourage consumers to recycle their own plastic waste

## We barely recycle plastic!!..

# Agenda

1. Rational of the research
2. Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM)
3. Research questions
4. Framework
5. Case study: Green Fablab
6. Limits & Suggestions

# Rationale

.pull-left[

Additive manufacturing is a manufacturing vector in the short future

Innovations Spaces

# Rationale: Distributed Recycling

.pull-left[ 
Geographical distributed spaces where the polymer recycling process of the surrounding areas will be carried out.

- **Hypothesis:** Plastic recycling by 3D Printing and low cost injection technologies in a local circuit for innovation labs.

Benefits:
- Avoid the use of the environment as a sink for residuals
- Minimize the use of virgin materials

# Research Question

.pull-left[

In short/long term, 
- Distributed recycling can influence the *intention of recycling*?

- How we can create a local closed loop recycling people use recycled products based on the DRAM ?
