# The problem: Plastic waste

.pull-left[ 
- US recycled less than 9% of its plastic waste.
- EU, recycled about 30%. However, this number is what is collected, not from what is in circulation*. 
- China’s ban on plastic trash
- Plastic trash could top 13 billion tons by 2050
- Economics of plastic recycling historically have been challenging
- Little financial incentive to encourage consumers to recycle their own plastic waste

## We barely recycle plastic!!..

# The problem: Plastic waste

The development of sustainable industrial supply chains

.left-column[
.small[

- Only technico-economic criteria alone do not (no longer) enables a informed decision making 

- Need to assess value chains in a different way, including actual impacts on ecosystems

- A more holistic vision is needed to assess the feasibility of these new sectors.

# Rationale: Distributed Recycling

.pull-left[ 
Geographical distributed spaces where plastic recycling  can be performed at surrounding areas.

- **Hypothesis:** Plastic recycling by 3D Printing and low cost technologies in a local circuit for innovation labs.

Benefits:
- Avoid the use of the environment as a sink for residuals
- Minimize the use of virgin materials

# Research Question

.pull-left[

In short/long term, 
- Distributed recycling can influence the *intention of recycling*?



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LF2L/everest-bio/master/slides/figures/Green-fablab-0.png)

]

.pull-right[

- How we can create a local closed loop recycling people use recycled products based on the DRAM ?

# Theoretical framework


.left-column[

- Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB)

.right-column[

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/TPB/TPB.jpeg")
```
]

.small[

- Attitude: The extent to which plastic recycling is valued by people, whether positive or negative
- Subjective Norms: The extent to which people are influenced by perceived norms of plastic recycling in their  surroundings
- Perceived Behavioral Control (PCB): the perceived power (and knowledge) of people to implement plastic recycling
- Behavioral intention: A perceived likelihood or subjective probability they will implement plastic recycling.

# Results
## Factors influencing Attitude


```{r, include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Results/ATT2-00.jpeg")
```

- at least 88% of interviewees agreed or strongly agreed that knowing the results of recycling and availability of collection points and improved their perception of recycling 
- Enthusiasm was lower for the answer “advertising”

# Results
## Factors influencing Subjective Norm


```{r, include=TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("Figures/Results/SN-00.jpeg")
```

- the fact of knowing the result of recycling and the availability of collection points do contribute to a better image of recycling in their community

# Limits

- The context of the fair is not representative
- The filière of recycling is not 
- More research is need to put in highlight more parameters that enable the acceptability of use recycled material.

# Perspectives

Technical system --> Global system

- Establish and evaluate scenarios in a systemic and dynamic way

- Evaluate the influences of the main operating variables on the system

- Taking into account the priorities of the multiple stakeholders

- Facilitate your decision making public-private actors
